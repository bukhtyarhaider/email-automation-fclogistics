# Outreach Desk 2 validation

Validated on October 10, 2026 on macOS with Node 20.20.2 and Python 3. No additional real emails were sent during the version 2 upgrade.

## Automated checks

`npm test`: **34 passed** (28 Node tests, 6 Python tests).

- New installations have no fixed customer, mailbox, lead workbook, or suppression addresses.
- Sixteen template variants personalize the active profile, opt-out copy, and business details; selection respects enabled status, required lead fields, weights, and the previous selection.
- Random send gaps and longer rests obey configurable bounds.
- Mailbox-specific hourly and rolling 24-hour allowances pause processing rather than discard the queue.
- Continuous processing sends a synthetic workbook, waits after exhaustion, accepts another campaign, retains send history, and preserves both enabled and stopped states across restarts. Reconnection is required before a saved enabled queue resumes.
- Deleted templates stay deleted after restarting.
- Lost send confirmation stops the runner, records uncertainty, and blocks automatic retries after restart. Workbook repair never resends a confirmed message.
- Two independent worker servers using one local coordinator send three synthetic recipients exactly once each. Mailbox passwords never appear in the shared ledger.
- Concurrent coordinator claims permit only one owner; suppression, quotas, and minimum mailbox intervals are shared. Sending reservations never expire into eligibility. Restart converts unfinished Sending records into Uncertain.
- XLSX header aliases and explicit mappings work for import and status patching; unrelated ZIP parts, formulas, cell styles, and source files remain intact.

## Live local UI

- Migrated existing workspace shows 9,208 leads, 2,881 ready, 6,327 excluded, and both previously recorded sends. Existing suppression entries remain available.
- Confirmed 16 template options, token migration, unchanged saved settings, personalized lead preview, custom template creation and deletion, and the searchable send-history view.
- Browser console showed no application errors during these checks.
- Older version-1 attempts explicitly report that full body/template/signature details were not recorded then; no retrospective details were invented.
- Existing signature-preserving Private Email compose/send behavior was verified in version 1. Version 2 replaces fixed sender selectors with the saved active account. No additional real sends were used to exercise continuous mode.

## Distribution and limits

The archive contains only explicit source/documentation/launcher/test files. It excludes local data, originals, working workbooks, screenshots, customer history, mail sessions, node_modules, and team ledger/token files. macOS launcher execute permissions are included in the ZIP.

Windows setup/start scripts are supplied and reviewed but have not been executed on a Windows PC. macOS is the tested platform. Installation needs Node, Python, Chrome or Edge, and an npm dependency installation; this is not a standalone executable.

The tool can run continuously while the PC, server, browser, network, and mailbox session remain available. It does not install an OS background service or store mailbox passwords for reboot login. Team duplicate protection requires every PC to connect to one shared coordinator; no externally accessible coordinator was deployed. Automatic reply/bounce reading and other providers' webmail adapters are not implemented.
